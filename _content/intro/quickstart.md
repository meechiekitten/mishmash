Hello, friends! Ready to read some documentation about writing documentation?

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/img/so-meta.jpg"
  alt="so meta"
  caption="The meta. It hurts."
%}

The goal of this quickstart is to get you up-and-running with the basics of viewing and editing the documentation. If you're a developer looking for information about getting started with your own instance of these docs, [see the developer quickstart]({{ site.github.url }}/developers/quickstart).

## First, Some Vocabulary

In the interest of keeping everyone on the same page, we're doing our best to avoid jargon, but we also need to have names for things. As you read through these docs, there are a few terms that will be used often.

- **repository** (or **repo** for short) — this is where the underlying code for the documentation is stored. For the docs your reading right now, the repository is <{{ site.github_repo }}>. In some of the instructions you'll be asked to visit the repository (for instance, when [uploading new images]({{ site.github.url }}/formatting/images#how-to-add-new-images-to-the-documentation))
- **Markdown** — this is how text is formatted. We dive deep into this in the [formatting]({{ site.github.url }}/formatting/cheatsheet) section.
- **live docs** — this is referring to the actual documentation website. For the docs you're reading right now, that's <{{ site.github.url }}>. In many of the instructions, you'll be asked to look at the live docs to see your changes.

## Your First Edit in 5 Minutes or Less

Now that we're on the same page with terminology, let's make our first edit to the documentation.

### Step 1: Find the page you want to edit on the live docs.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/img/quickstart-step-1.png"
  alt="the page we want to edit on the live docs"
  caption="The live docs, looking at the page we want to edit."
%}

First up, we need to find the page we want to edit in the live docs. For example, if we wanted to edit _this_ page, we're already done with this step if we're looking at it from the live docs (which lives at {{ site.github.url }}/intro/quickstart).

### Step 2: Click the edit link at the top-right of the page.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/img/quickstart-step-2.png"
  alt="the edit this page button"
  caption="The “Edit This Page” button on the live docs."
%}

Next, we need to click the "<i class="u-icon--before u-icon--pencil"></i> Edit This Page" link. 

### Step 3: Make an edit to the page.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/img/quickstart-step-3.gif"
  alt="making edits"
  caption="To make an edit, simply start typing."
%}

The page that opens is the repo's editor. Inside, make a small edit (may we suggest, "Documentation is awesome!"?).

### Step 4: Save the change.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/img/quickstart-step-4.png"
  alt="the edit this page button"
  caption="The “Edit This Page” button on the live docs."
%}

After we've made our change, we need to save them. This is done by adding a description of our changes in the "Commit changes" 

### Step 5: View the change on the live docs.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/img/quickstart-step-5.png"
  alt="the change is visible on the live docs"
  caption="The live docs show our changes after saving."
%}

After saving our changes, we can head back to the live docs and we'll see our changes on the page.

### Step 6: Use the remaining time for a dance party.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/img/dance-party.gif"
  alt="dance party"
  caption="Victory!"
%}

Since we definitely didn't spend a full five minutes making these changes, use the remaining time to bust out a victory dance.

## Next Steps

Now that you've got the basics down, you're ready to dive deeper into what the documentation is capable of. When you're ready, you can:

- Learn more about [formatting content with Markdown]({{ site.github.url }}/formatting/cheatsheet)
- Learn how to [add new pages to the documentation]({{ site.github.url }}/content/pages)

Check out the sidebar for a full list of things to learn about the docs. If you have a question about something that's _not_ in the docs, [open an issue]({{ site.github_repo }}/issues) so we can improve them.
