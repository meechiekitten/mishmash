title: Headings and Subheadings

On most pages, it makes sense to break up content with headings. This makes the page more scannable, and helps ensure that users can jump directly to the content they need.

## This is a section heading.

These are also called _subheadings_, or _second-level headings_.

You can add one of these by starting a line with two pound signs (`#`) — "hashtags" if you're under 25 — and adding the headline afterward, like so:

``` md
## This is a section heading.
```

Treat section headings like an outline of the page: if a user _only_ reads the section headings, they should know what the page contains.

### This is a subsection heading.

If you need to break up content inside a section, you can create a _subsection_ by adding three pound signs (`#`) at the beginning of a line, followed by the subsection heading text:

``` md
### This is a subsection heading.
```

Think about subsection headings as the bullet points you might put on a slide for the section. What are the key facts? Add them here.

#### This is a sub-subsection heading.

Wait, really? How deep are we going here?

Sometimes — and it should be pretty rare — you'll need to break up a subsection with a sub-subsection. Do it by adding four pound signs (`#`) at the beginning of a new line, followed by the sub-subsection heading text:

``` md
#### This is a sub-subsection heading.
```

In most cases, this many sub-levels might be a good reason to break the content into separate pages; you risk burying the content and overwhelming the user if you end up this deep.

An exception to this is if you're explaining a group of things that have attributes (for example: if the page is about food, the section might be about fruit, the subsection might be about citrus, and the sub-subsection might be a few words about oranges). But be wary of getting too complex with your headings.

##### This is a sub-sub-subsection.

Seriously? Stop it.

If you _really_ need to get into the details, you can add a _sub-sub-subsection_ by adding five pound signs (`#`) on a new line, followed by the sub-sub-subsection heading text:

``` md
##### This is a sub-sub-subsection.
```

But, honestly, if you find yourself here, you probably ought to be breaking these up into multiple pages.

###### This is a sub-sub-sub-subsection.

Okay, now you're just fucking with me.

(You can make these with six pound signs [`#`] on a new line, followed by the sub-sub-sub-subsection heading text.)

``` md
###### This is a sub-sub-sub-subsection.
```

However, don't do this. It's too complex. And that's as deep as it goes — there is no seven-level-deep header. Because that would be madness.
