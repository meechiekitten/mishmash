title: Create Docs Quickly & Painlessly — No Coding Required!
---
No matter how great your product, app, idea, or process is, **no one will use it if they don't understand it.** And the best way to help someone understand something is to create simple, helpful documentation.

But also: writing documentation _sucks_.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/img/docs-venn.svg"
  alt="writing documentation sucks Venn diagram"
  caption="Writing documentation is not high on my list of things to do today."
  border=false
  lightbox=false
%}

That's why we're here: writing docs is awful enough without _also_ needing to build a documentation website.

This documentation starter solves all the getting started problems, so you can just write great docs and watch the love notes roll in from your users.

## Easy for content writers.

Are you uncomfortable with code? **No problem!**

Thanks to the magic behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), you can edit the entire site using the GitHub interface — no code required.

All you need to know is a few simple formatting tricks and you've got everything you need to create beautiful, user-friendly documentation.

{% include button.html
    href="intro/quickstart"
    text="Get Started in 5 Minutes"
%}

## Easy for developers.

Are you a developer? Never fear — this is not a nightmare CMS.

This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), so you can easily add new partials, edit the theme, or completely modify the templates.

Most modifications will only require [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or [Liquid templates](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/). Styles are plain ol' CSS (with modern features enabled by [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/)).

Nothing crazy. No databases. No complicated JavaScript. Just a simple documentation framework.

{% include button.html
    href="developers/overview"
    text="See Customization Docs"
%}
